# 👋 Hi, I’m Mehrnaz!
</br>

👀 I’m a 25 year old Data Science and AI MSc student at the University of Liverpool.

🖌️ I have a bachelors in Architectrue, so I have a mix of both design and technical skills!

💻 Currently, I'm having fun learning and implementing machine learning algorithms.

❇️ Fun fact: I'm a huge videogame fan. My favorite game is God of War 2018, with Genshin Impact being a close second.
